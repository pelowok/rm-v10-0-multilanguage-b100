1. typeface creates difficult-to-distinguish "l" and "i" characters in hero section subheader

2. form fails to expose error messages after POSTDATA

3. carousel image and text alignment is inconsistently centered

4. typeface weight for subheaders needs to increase for legibility

5. footer needs formatting

6. hero section header typeface decreases too much when viewed at highly-compact screen sizes (mobile)

7. [technical debt] format and label content repository for ease-of-use by Tammy

8. carousel images and paragraphs are being clipped on the bottom at smaller screen sizes

9. page needs to automatically scroll to top of form when form is opened - currently the form will open and parts of it will be below the fold

10. at small screen sizes, if the form is opened while it is 'sticky' [stuck to the top once it is scrolled past], the user can not scroll down the form in order to complete it - instead it stays stuck to the top

11. [technical debt] code base is split between development on hubspot and master on github. code repo needs to be updated in master from hubspot
